# 🎲 Pig Game

A simple **2-player dice game** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on **DOM manipulation, game logic, and event handling** in JavaScript.


## 🕹️ Game Rules

- The game is played between **two players**.
- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- On each roll:
  - 🎲 A number between **1 and 6** is generated.
  - The number is added to the player’s **current score**.
- ⚠️ If a player rolls a **1**:
  - The current score is reset to **0**
  - The turn switches to the other player.
- 📥 A player can click **Hold** to:
  - Add the current score to their **total score**
  - End their turn.
- 🏆 The **first player to reach 100 points** wins the game.
- 🔄 The **New Game** button resets the game state.
